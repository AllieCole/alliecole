### Hello!! ðŸ‘‹

I am a current student at UCSB's Bren school getting my masters in Environmental Data Science. Previously I was getting my undergrad degree at Boston University in Marine Science where I had the wonderful oppertunity to work in Randi Rotjan's Marine Ecology Lab, and studied deep sea, open ocean, and coral reef fish larvae in the Phoenix Islands Protected Area on an ongoing 10-year project to determine how taxonomic assemblages change across ENSO cycles. Check out this fun video of my work [here!](https://www.bu.edu/articles/2019/phoenix-islands-fieldwork-vlog/)
